<longdescription>Qpitch is a cross-platform musical instrument tuner. It automatically 
detects the note with signal autocorrelation, and displays a waveform.

Qpitch is based loosely on <pkg>media-sound/k3guitune</pkg>,
which is no longer maintained. Qpitch is mostly rewritten, and updated for Qt4.
