  18 Jun 2006; Gustavo Felisberto <humpback@gentoo.org>; ChangeLog:
  Removed amd64 deps as they do not cover all that is needed and the amd64
  team is not going to fix this. One should pester upstream and ask for a 64
  bits package.

  18 Jun 2006; Stefan Schweizer <genstef@gentoo.org> +gizmo-1.0.0.18.ebuild:
  New ebuild by me with help from bug 103587
