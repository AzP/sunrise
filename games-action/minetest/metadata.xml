		Minetest is a free and open source infinite-world block sandbox game and
		a game engine, inspired by InfiniMiner, Minecraft and the like. It has 
		been in development since October 2010.
		It is Free and Open Source Software, released under the GPL. This way
		it is more readily available to Linux users, and random people (you!)
		can fix bugs and experiment effectively.		
		Minetest is developed by Perttu "celeron55" Ahola and a number of
		contributors.		
		Minetest is technically simple, stable and portable. It is lightweight
		enough to run on fairly old hardware. It currently runs playably on a
		laptop with Intel 945GM graphics. Though, as for the CPU, dualcore is
		recommended.
