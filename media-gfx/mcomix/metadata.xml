	<longdescription>MComix is an image viewer specifically designed to handle comic books, but also serves as a generic viewer. It reads images either directly or in various archive formats. MComix is a fork of <pkg>media-gfx/comix</pkg>, and aims to add bug fixes and stability improvements after Comix development came to a halt in late 2009.</longdescription>
