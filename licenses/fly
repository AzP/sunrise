The image of the fly in the logo on these pages is the head of a house fly taken
with a Scanning Electron Microscope at 55 times magnification. Made by Duncan
Waddell at the Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis at the University of
Queensland, it and many other electron microscopy images can be found at the
Nanoworld Image Gallery. Many thanks to them for providing the service.
