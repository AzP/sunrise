		EggTranslations is a flexible object-oriented resource loader that is
		designed to work in projects that are distributed as Python eggs. Its main
		goals are to support localization of resources (e.g. images, help files and
		other documentation), and to allow localization of text in your application
		by loading GNU gettext .mo files. However, you don't have to be dealing with
		localizable resources to use EggTranslations: You can use it to organize
		non-localizable resources, too.
