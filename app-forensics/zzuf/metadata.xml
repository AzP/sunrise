From http://sam.zoy.org/zzuf/

zzuf is a transparent application input fuzzer. Its purpose is to find bugs
in applications by corrupting their user-contributed data (which more than 
often comes from untrusted sources on the Internet). It works by intercepting 
file and network operations and changing random bits in the program’s input. 
zzuf’s behaviour is deterministic, making it easier to reproduce bugs. 

Its main areas of use are:

    - 	quality assurance: use zzuf to test existing software, 
	or integrate it into your own software’s testsuite

    - 	security: very often, segmentation faults or memory corruption issues 
	mean a potential security hole, zzuf helps exposing some of them

zzuf’s primary target is media players, image viewers and web browsers, because 
the data they process is inherently insecure, but it was also successfully used 
to find bugs in system utilities such as objdump.
