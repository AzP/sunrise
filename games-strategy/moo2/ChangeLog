  * Reformatted to 80 cols
  * Changed license to GPL-2 MicroProse-EULA, repoman can deal
  * Added icon & make_desktop_entry
  * Added prepgamesdirs to the end of src_install() which I forgot earlier!
  * Added functionality for the moo2 script to backup your saved games (I
    had this earlier, but it wasn't working yet).

  New ebuild for bug #341859. The "Lord Brazen" version is actually labled
  1.40b.23, but I'm omitting the "b" as it neither fits in Gentoo's
  versioning convention or seems to make much sense.
