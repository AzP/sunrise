      <p>1. Purpose and audience for this FAQ</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>This FAQ provides answers to frequently asked questions for the
        Master of Orion II v1.40 patch which I began writing in December 2003.
        The reason I wrote this FAQ is quite simple, a growing number of people
        keep asking me the same questions about the patch.</p>

      <p>2. Acknowledgments</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Thanks go out to all those within the Moo2 kali community that have
        very supportive of this project:<br>

    <p><strong>Questions and Answers</strong></p>

    <p>1. Installation</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>1.1. What are the requirements of the patch?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>This patch requires the DOS v1.31 English version of Master of Orion
        II. It will not work with earlier versions, other language versions, or
        the windows version of the game. You should be able to patch a
        non-english version of master of Orion II with the english v1.31 patch
        and effectively convert it to the english version (which should allow
        you to apply the v1.40 patch at that point).</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>1.2. How do I apply the patch?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Applying the patch is simple. Just put the patch exe file into the
        orion2 game directory and run it. It will create a separate
        orion2v140.exe file. This is the patched game executable. It will also
        optionally create a desktop icon for you which you can use to launch
        the game.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>1.3. How do I configuring the Moo2v140 desktop shortcut?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>I would recommend that you use the patch to create a desktop icon.
        It is a shortcut.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>1.4. Why only the DOS version?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>I primarily play orion2 on the internet using kali. The windows
        version of the game does not play very well over the internet (to much
        lag).</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>1.5. How do I launch Moo2v140 from Kali?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Many players use a private server and the desktop shortcut to launch
        the game. Game lobbies are also an option and very commonly used by new
        players. Refer to the kali web site for instructions.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>1.6. How do I launch Moo2v140 from DOSBox?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Setting up a DOSBox game can be more difficult than with Kali but
        the players tend to experience less lag during game play. The host of
        the game must use the 'ipxnet startserver' command in the dosbox window
        prior to starting orion2. All other players must use the 'ipxnet
        connect x.x.x.x' command (where x.x.x.x is the hosts ip address) in the
        dosbox window prior to starting orion2.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>

    <p>2. Bug fixes</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>2.1. What are the bugs in the latest (v1.31) official patch?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Leaders bug</strong> - The game will instantly crash when
        you attempt to view your ship leaders but have no ships.</p>

        <p><strong>Arti bug</strong> - This is a LAN game bug that occurs when
        you are the first player to arrive an arti system. You will receive the
        free technologies but the arti planet may permanently lose the arti
        planet special on the next turn.</p>

        <p><strong>Last race bugs</strong> - LAN games crash when a player
        presses the Last Race button. Also, it is possible to pick the same
        race picture as an opponent in multiplayer games.</p>

        <p><strong>Credit cheat</strong> - Under certain circumstances a player
        can both produce an item and receive trade goods (full amount) at a
        single planet in a single turn. This is an exploit used to generate
        large amounts of cash by some players.</p>

        <p><strong>Auto factory bug</strong> - The game can crash when you
        mouse over a building in the colony screen. This often occurs when you
        go to scrap an Auto Factory but can occur with other buildings
        also.</p>

        <p><strong>Cloned monsters</strong> - Under certain circumstances the
        combat round with a monster is ignored. Sometimes monsters or ships
        which were destroyed in combat are still alive after combat. This seems
        to be a network game problem only.</p>

        <p><strong>Cloned cship or opship</strong> - Sometimes a colony ship or
        outpost ship is not deleted after it is used to make a colony or
        outpost. It can be exploited to generate a very large empire in a very
        short period of time.</p>

        <p><strong>Soils bug</strong> - Quite often in the round that you
        produce a building which creates a food or production bonus, the bonus
        is not applied properly to all workers that turn. Moving workers around
        can result in all or part of the bonus being lost temporarily or even a
        game crash.</p>

        <p><strong>Retreat from battle field</strong> - Retreating from a
        battle sometimes can result in a game crash. It seems to only occur in
        LAN games when you retreat from the edge of the combat area.</p>

        <p><strong>Retreat with navigator</strong> - Retreating from combat can
        result in loss of your entire fleet if there is a black hole in the
        retreat path even if you have a navigator.</p>

        <p><strong>Travel distance/ETA incorrect</strong> - Travel distance and
        ETA are not calculated correctly in some situations.</p>

        <p><strong>Annihilation bug</strong> - Under certain circumstances,
        annihilation can result in a planet with zero population. It is
        impossible to invade or bomb. Also, if an invader remains in orbit of
        this system it can prevent the invader from entering combat at other
        systems as well. This can be exploited to create a permanent
        outpost.</p>

        <p><strong>Overpopulation bug</strong> - Under certain circumstances,
        it is possible to overpopulate a planet with androids or captured
        races. This can be exploited to create a super planet.</p>

        <p><strong>Not asked to land opship when cship is present</strong> -
        When a colony ship and outpost ship are present with your fleet,
        sometimes you will not be given the option to land your outpost ship.
        This seems to occur in systems with no habitable worlds.</p>

        <p><strong>Phantom missiles</strong> - Shooting down missiles can
        result in a missile stack with a quantity of zero. The defender can
        waste many defensive shots on them but these missiles cannot be shot
        down. The missiles will proceed to target but they seem to do no
        damage.</p>

        <p><strong>Stealth bug</strong> - Ships equipped with the stealth
        technology are still visible on the galaxy map by your opponents. They
        are visible at the same range as regular ships.</p>

        <p><strong>Cloaking and Phase Cloaking bugs</strong> - Ships equipped
        with the Cloaking or Phase Cloaking technology are still visible on the
        galaxy map by your opponents. Also, during combat only player #0 will
        have his phase cloak revert to regular cloaking after 10 rounds.</p>

        <p><strong>System Specials not shared</strong> - When two players
        arrive for the first time at a system with a system special, only one
        player will receive the special (such as rescued leader, money, or
        technology).</p>

        <p><strong>Evolutionary Mutation</strong> - It is possible to change
        some race picks that you should not be able to once you have researched
        Evolutionary Mutation.</p>

        <p><strong>Repeat build cheat</strong> - It is possible to cancel the
        production of a repeat build item after it has been bought. This allows
        money to be converted to stored production. It can be exploited to
        purchase expensive items by canceling multiple cheaper repeat built
        items over the course of several turns.</p>

        <p><strong>Tractors bug</strong> - Moving a ship while tractor beams
        are engaged can often crash the game. The crashes occur most frequently
        if one of the ships involved are off the screen.</p>

        <p><strong>Tech Trading bug</strong> - You cannot demand or trade
        optronics computer technology.</p>

        <p><strong>Stolen Tech bug</strong> - Some stolen technologies do not
        apply until you build a new colony or outpost.</p>

        <p><strong>Autobuild bug</strong> - Autobuild can be exploited to
        produce an item and trade goods in the same turn. The exploit is very
        simular to Credit Cheat.</p>

        <p><strong>Stategic outposts bug</strong> - Outposts are often
        destroyed in strategic combat even when the defender wins combat.</p>

        <p><strong>Time Warp Facilitator bug</strong> - Ships equiped with
        phasing cloak and time warp facilitator can re-cloak in the same combat
        round in which they fire weapons. This make the ships impossible to
        destroy.</p>

        <p><strong>Black Hole Generator bug</strong> - Black Hole Generator
        does not destroy ships when ship initiative is enabled. The ships
        remain immobilized rather than being destroyed on 3rd turn.</p>

        <p><strong>Immobilization bug</strong> - Ships are not immobilized by
        tractor beams or blackhole generators until the beginning of the next
        combat round. This allows them to move when they should not be able
        to.</p>

      <p>2.2. What bugs does the v1.40 patch fix?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>At present only leaders, arti, credit cheat, stealth, cloned
        op/cship, repeat build, cloak, phase cloak, tractors, blackhole
        generators, VESA, and last race.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>2.3. What bugs do you plan to fix?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Hopefully all of them.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>

    <p>3. New command line switches</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>3.1. What command line switches are there already in v1.31?</p>

      <p>The command line switches that I am aware of are:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>/skipintro</strong> Skips the intro movie.</p>

          <p><strong>/monsters = num</strong> Sets the preferred number of
          monsters. Valid values are 0 to 255. Default is 255 which is random
          seed.</p>

          <p><strong>/nolog</strong> Sets a flag in the game that seems to
          never be used anyways.</p>

          <p><strong>/net = value</strong> Parsed but seems to do nothing.</p>

          <p><strong>/date</strong> Displays the version date and exits
          game.</p>

          <p><strong>/maps = value</strong> Parsed but seems to do nothing.</p>

          <p><strong>/seed = num</strong> Seed for random number generator.
          Valid values are signed long integer (-2147483648 to 2147483647).
          Default is 0. Seems to only effect first galaxy map generated and
          does not effect monster placement.</p>

          <p><strong>/saveset = value</strong> Something to do with autosave
          but seems bugged.</p>

          <p><strong>/saveset</strong> Something to do with autosave but seems
          bugged.</p>

          <p><strong>/quickstart</strong> Parsed but seems to do nothing.</p>

          <p><strong>/nosaves = value</strong> Parsed but seems to do
          nothing.</p>

          <p><strong>/stats = value</strong> Parsed but seems to do
          nothing.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>3.2. What command line switches have been added in v1.40?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>/nowh</strong> No wormholes are generated on new maps</p>

          <p><strong>/nobh</strong> No black holes are generated on new
          maps</p>

          <p><strong>/noorion</strong> Orion and Guardian are not generated on
          new maps</p>

          <p><strong>/noreport</strong> The report button on the diplomacy
          screen will be disabled preventing you from seeing what technology
          your opponent has. Also, Technology demands and trades are greyed
          out.</p>

          <p><strong>/droids</strong> All players start out with the ability to
          build androids (all 3 types).</p>

          <p><strong>/minstart</strong> The unoccupied planet closest to the
          sun in all home systems will be at least 2 production per worker and
          its gravity will match that of the homeworld.</p>

          <p><strong>/hugestart</strong> The unoccupied planet closest to the
          sun in all home systems will be huge and its gravity will match that
          of the homeworld.</p>

          <p><strong>/richstart</strong> The unoccupied planet closest to the
          sun in all home systems will be rich and its gravity will match that
          of the homeworld (this switch is ignored if /goodstart is used).</p>

          <p><strong>/goodstart</strong> The unoccupied planet closest to the
          sun in all home systems will be Ultra Rich and its gravity will match
          that of the homeworld.</p>

          <p><strong>/nosplint</strong> No splinter worlds unless there is a
          monster guarding it.</p>

          <p><strong>/planets = num</strong> Sets the minimum number of planets
          in all home systems to num. This value includes the home world. Valid
          values are<br>
          2-5 (default is 2). If you try a value outside of the valid range it
          will use the default.</p>

          <p><strong>/picks = num</strong> Sets the starting race picks points
          to num. Valid values are 10-14 (default is 10). If you try a value
          outside of the valid range it will use the default. Note: some
          screens in the game only show the first 11 race picks (it is possible
          to pick more than 11).</p>

          <p><strong>/nonebula</strong> When used the map is generated without
          any nebulas.</p>

          <p><strong>/nohousing</strong> The housing option will no longer be
          available from the build list so housing production will not be
          possible. Also, this switch adds +150% bonus to population growth.
          The bonus will be added into the growth formula exactly the same way
          that the bonus from universal antidote is.</p>

          <p><strong>/noscan</strong> This switch will disable the scan button
          in combat so that detailed scans of ships will no longer be possible.
          Only quick scans will be possible by mousing over the ships.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>NOTE: the switches /minstart, /hugestart, /richstart, and /goodstart
        all effect the same planet. The effect is cumulative. These switches
        ONLY EFFECT ONE PLANET. ALL OTHERS ARE COMPLETELY RANDOM.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>3.3. How do I use the command line switches?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>You need to edit the properties of desktop shortcut. Just right
        click the icon and pick properties. Go to the program tab. On the
        command line add the switches you want at the end *(after /skipintro)
        with spaces between each and click ok.</p>

        <p>NOTE: If you do not spell things correctly there will be no errors
        when you start the game. Your misspelled switch will simply be ignored.
        Also, Windows has a limit to the length of the command line. It will
        not tell you that you have reached this limit. It will just chop off
        some switches that are over the limit. You can reopen the shortcut
        properties and look at the command line to verify that the switches are
        not chopped off.<br></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>3.4. Who needs to use the command line switches in a multiplayer
      game?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>With the exception of the /picks switch, only the host needs to use
        the command line switches. The switches from all other players are
        ignored (except /picks).</p>

        <p>The /picks switch in a LAN game must be put on every players command
        line (if you do not put it on your command line then you will receive
        the default of 10 points). Each player can have a different number of
        race pick points. This will allow people to play with a handicap if the
        choose to.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>3.5. What command line switches do you plan to add in the future?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Check my blog site. I usually post what I am working on.<br></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>3.6. Why do the save games from v1.40 cause problems with the Map
      editor / Leveler?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>This issue only effected old versions of the patch. Please upgrade
        to v1.40b21 or later.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>3.7. How do the home system switches interact with each other?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>The home system switches effects add where possible, however they
        only impact one planet in the home system. For example:</p>

        <p>/hugestart /goodstart gives a huge ultra rich planet</p>

        <p>/hugestart /minstart only gives a huge planet</p>

        <p>/richstart /goodstart only gives an ultra rich</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>3.8. Why does the galaxy map seem different in v1.40?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>The /nobh switch converts black holes into stars. As a result, there
        will be a slight change in the galaxy quality (a few extra planets) if
        this switch is used.<br>
        Also, the home systems are improved slightly. This obviously has an
        effect on the overall galaxy quality.<br>
        The /noorion switch prevents the game from generating Orion and instead
        it generates a regular system in its place.<br>
        Also, the /nosplint switch converts splinters into gold deposits. There
        will be a slight increase in the number of gold deposit worlds if this
        switch is used.</p>
      </blockquote>

    <p>4. Playing over the internet</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>4.1. How do I play Master of Orion 2 over the internet?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>I recommend playing using Kali and Windows 98 as your operating
        system. This is the best combination that I have tried so far. There
        are also frequently several players on the Kali MOO2 server who enjoy
        playing games regularly.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>4.2. What is kali?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Kali is software that lets you play LAN games over the internet. It
        supports DOS games well. There are many chat servers and game lobbies
        for players to meet and organize games.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>4.3. Where do I get kali?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><a href="http://www.kali.net">http://www.kali.net</a></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>4.4. What game server do people play Master of Orion 2 on?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Come join us on the kali -&gt;MOO2 chat server (currently #138 in
        the server list). There are several regular players on this server to

      <p>4.5. Why cant I find the MOO2 server?<br></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Sometime you do not get the full list of Kali chat servers when you
        load kali. What you need to do is refresh the list. It may take several
        refreshes to get all 300+ servers on the list.</p>

      <p>5.2. Why do you plan to disable cheat codes in multiplayer games ?</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>There is no reason to cheat in a multiplayer game. If you want to
        cheat, do so in a single player game.<br></p>
