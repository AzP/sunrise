		RipWrap is a Gtk2::Perl application for encoding from various video
		formats (including DVD's) to various formats. It neatly wraps MPlayer
		and MEncoder,
		two of the best tools for playing and encoding video. It additionally
		wraps around MP4Box to allow output of mpeg 4 files.
		As well as creating a simple interface for those scared of getting down
		and dirty with MEncoders
		command line interface, It also automates the process in a number of
		ways.
